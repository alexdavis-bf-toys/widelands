Our scripting support contains the stripped down essentials of pluto[1]. You
find the complete source and README of pluto on the github repo from one of
it's authors Rob Hoelz at [2]. Our version of pluto has been heavily modified
to create system agnostic files and to work with the widelands file streaming.
The Widelands Team wishes to expresses total and complete gratitude to the
authors of Pluto for making it public domain.
