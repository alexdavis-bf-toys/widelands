/**
 * WareInstance represents one item while it is being carried around.
 *
 * The WareInstance never draws itself; the carrying worker or the current flag
 * location are responsible for that.
 *
 * For robustness reasons, a WareInstance can only exist in a location that
 * assumes responsible for updating the instance's economy via \ref set_economy,
 * and that destroys the WareInstance when the location is destroyed.
 *
 * Currently, the location of a ware can be one of the following:
 * \li a \ref Flag
 * \li a \ref Worker that is currently carrying the ware
 * \li a \ref PortDock or \ref Ship where the ware is encapsulated in a \ref ShippingItem
 *     for seafaring
