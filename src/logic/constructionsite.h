ConstructionSite
----------------
A "building" that acts as a placeholder during construction work.
Once the construction phase is finished, the ConstructionSite is removed
and replaced by the actual building.

A construction site can have a worker.
A construction site has one (or more) input wares types, each with an
  associated store.

Note that the ConstructionSite_Descr class is mostly a dummy class.
The ConstructionSite is derived from Building so that it fits in more cleanly
with the transport and Flag code.

Every tribe has exactly one ConstructionSite_Descr.
The ConstructionSite's idling animation is the basic construction site marker.
