	/// consume its input wares in order. First it consumes wares of type a. It
	/// starts with the first group and consumes 1 (the group becomes

	/// left to consume. Since there is no other ware type that can satisfy the
	/// group, the command will fail. If the groups are reordered so that the
	/// parameters become "a:1 a,b:1", it will work. When the algorithm consumes
	/// wares of type a, it will consume 1 for the first group. When it proceeds
	/// with the second group, it will not have any a's left. Then it will go on
	/// and consume wares of type b. it will consume 1 for the second group
	/// (which becomes satisfied) and the command succeeds.
	///
