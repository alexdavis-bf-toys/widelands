/// You know main functions, of course. This is the main struct.

/// The oversimplified version: everything else is either game logic or GUI.

/// WLAppplication bundles all initialization and shutdown code in one neat
/// package. It also includes all (well, most) system abstractions, notably
/// i18n, input handling, timing, low level networking and graphics setup (the
/// actual graphics work is done by Graphic).
///
/// \todo Is the above part about i18n still true? \#bedouin
///
/// Equally important, the main event loop is chugging along in this class.
/// [not yet but some time in the future \#bedouin8sep2007]
///
/// \par WLApplication is a singleton
///
/// Because of it's special purpose, having more than one WLApplication is
/// useless. So we implement singleton semantics:
/// \li A private(!) static class variable (--> unique for the whole program,
///     although nobody can get at it) the_singleton holds a pointer to the
///     only instance of WLApplication. It is private because it would not be a
///     struct variable otherwise.
/// \li There is no public constructor. If there was, you would be able to
///     create more WLApplications. So constructor access must be encapsulated
///     too.
/// \li The only way to get at the WLApplication object is to call
///     WLApplication::get(), which is static as well. Because of this, get()
///     can access the_singleton even if no WLApplication object has been
///     instantiated yet. get() will \e always give you a valid WLApplication.
///     If one does not exist yet, it will be created.
/// \li A destructor does not make sense. Just make sure you call
///     shutdown_settings() and shutdown_hardware() when you are done - in a
///     sense, it is a destructor without the destruction part ;-)
///
/// These measures \e guarantee that there are no stray WLApplication objects
/// floating around by accident.
///
/// For testing purposes, we can spawn a second process with widelands running
/// in it (see init_double_game()). The fact that WLApplication is a singleton
/// is not touched by this: the processes start out as a byte exact memory
/// copy, so the two instances ca not know (except for fork()'s return value)
/// that they are (or are not) a primary thread. Each WLApplication singleton
/// really *is* a singleton - inside it's own process.
///
/// Forking does not work on windows, but nobody cares enough to investigate.
/// It is only a debugging convenience anyway.
///
///
/// \par The mouse cursor
///
/// SDL can handle a mouse cursor on its own, but only in black and white. That
/// is not sufficient.
///
/// So Widelands must paint its own cursor and hide the system cursor.
///
/// Ordinarily, relative coordinates break down when the cursor leaves the
/// window. This means we have to grab the mouse, then relative coords are
/// always available.
/// \todo Actually do grab the mouse when it is locked
///
/// \todo Graphics are currently not handled by WLApplication, and it is
/// non essential for playback anyway. Additionally, we will want several
/// rendering backends (software and OpenGL). Maybe the graphics backend loader
/// code should be in System, while the actual graphics work is done elsewhere.
/// \todo Refactor the mainloop
/// \todo Sensible use of exceptions (goes for whole game)
