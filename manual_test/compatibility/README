This directory contains savegame files of older official releases for
archiving and testing purposes.

For every official release, the goal is to retain savegame files that
- contain every tribe
- contain every world
- exercise all features of the game

For example, there should be savegame files that have an on-going battle,
and in general, savegame files should be of a decent sized game with several
players.
