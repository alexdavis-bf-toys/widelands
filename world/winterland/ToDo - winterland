BEFORE READING ToDo:

IMPORTANT:
do not delete any bobs integrate yet, because older maps 
(or swd-maps) won't work without these files.
AND:
do not include new files and do not delete files under /pics, 
because older maps (or swd-maps) won't work if content is changed.


THIS IS, WHAT IS LEFT ToDo:
    -better fitting trees
    -better fitting skeletons
    -rework of animals -> what an ungly reindeer :-P
    
feel free to make world 'winterland' better! 
Someone has to do this job!
