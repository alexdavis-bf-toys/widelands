# NOCOM(#sirver): remove this file again.

This file is to document the renames done in the process of the one_world effort.
These are important for backwards compatibility of maps (s2 and widelands) as
they will be hardcoded into the engine.

greenland terrains stayed without renames
blackland/ashes -> ashes
blackland/strand -> wasteland_beach
blackland/water -> wasteland_water
blackland/hardground* -> hardground*
blackland/lava -> removed, same as greenland/lava

desert/lava -> removed, same as greenland/lava

winterland/lava -> removed, same as greenland/lava

Resources:
granit -> granite

Critters:
<all_worlds>/bunny -> "bunny"
greenland/brownbear -> "brownbear"


Immovables:
greenland/tree1 -> "aspen_summer_old"
winterland/snowman -> "snowman"
