# NOCOM(#sirver): remove this file again.

This file is to document the renames done in the process of the one_world effort.
These are important for backwards compatibility of maps (s2 and widelands) as
they will be hardcoded into the engine.


Terrains:
greenland terrains stayed without renames
blackland/ashes -> ashes

Resources:
granit -> granite

Critters:
<all_worlds>/bunny -> "bunny"
greenland/brownbear -> "brownbear"


Immovables:
greenland/tree1 -> "aspen_summer_old"
winterland/snowman -> "snowman"
