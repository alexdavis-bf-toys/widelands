# NOCOM(#sirver): remove this file again.

This file is to document the renames done in the process of the one_world effort.
These are important for backwards compatibility of maps (s2 and widelands) as
they will be hardcoded into the engine.

Resources:
granit -> granite

Critters:
<all_worlds>/bunny -> "bunny"
greenland/brownbear -> "brownbear"
greeland/winterland deer -> "stag" (male deer)
blackland/desert deer -> "deer" (female deer)


Immovables:
<all_worlds>_skeleton1 => "skeleton1"
# NOCOM: The skeletons were in different order in different worlds.
# NOCOM: By vote of majority, skeleton2 is the ammonite, while skeleton3 is the mammoth skull
# NOCOM: I don't know how this will affect compatibility for older games...
greenland_skeleton2 => "skeleton2"
greenland/tree1 -> "aspen_summer_old"
winterland/snowman -> "snowman"
