BEFORE READING ToDo:

IMPORTANT:
do not delete any bobs integrate yet, because older maps won't work without these files.
adding new bobs is okay.
AND:
do not include new files and do not delete files under /pics, because older maps won't work if content is changed.



THIS IS, WHAT IS LEFT ToDo:
    -red stones instead of the grey stones of greenland
    -better palms
    -better ruins
    -add a few desert-animals 
    
feel free to make world 'desert' better! I am not good in creating artworks!
