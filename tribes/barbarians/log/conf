help=_Logs are a principal building material of the barbarians. The trees are felled by lumberjacks; rangers care for the supply of trees. Logs are also used in the metal workshop to build basic tools, and in the charcoal burnerâ€™s house in the production of coal. The wood hardener refines logs by hardening them in the fire which gives blackwood.
