He began to feel safer and his army began to drop their attention off the potential enemy. That was their undoing.

Dozens of years after only some crumbly ruins remain of these good old times, covered with moss and trees. Their shapes give only an idea about the craftsmanship of ancient constructors. Nobody knows why they (have) disappeared. Nobody knows why. People say that now nothing is blocking the road to wealth.
