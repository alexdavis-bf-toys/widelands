"When Chat’Karuth died, he was an old man, father to three strong and "
"ambitious sons and warlord to an army that could match any enemy willing to "
"rise against the ancient forests. Though at the end of his glorious reign, "
"Chat’Karuth left his eldest son, Thron, to succeed him as the tribe's "
"warlord – a decision that left his two brothers unsatisfied. The old warlord "
"knew that. As his father instructed him, Thron left the capital of "
"Al’thunran, the home of the Throne Among the Trees and withdrew his forces "
"to the high hills where he buried the corpse of his father. There he swore "
"to the gods and his father's spirit that he’d return to re-established "
"order. While his brothers raged in blind war against Thron and the few "
"forces he left to secure the borders of Al’thunran, the young warlord seeks "
"to reunite his ambitious brothers and force the tribes to march once again "
"under a common banner."
