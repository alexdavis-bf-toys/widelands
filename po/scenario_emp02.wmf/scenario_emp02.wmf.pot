This land is so peaceful, good and beautiful, I could stay here until the end of my life.<br> But until that day, may many years pass! For now, we must concentrate on the present, and build a few lumberjack's houses and a sawmill to produce some basic building materials.<br> But we shouldn't forget to preserve this natural bounty. These forests should last forever, so we really should build a forester's house too.\"<br><br>-- NEW OBJECTIVE --<br> "

It seems as if we stand close to a test - and it seems as if Saledus was right with his fear concerning the shipwreck he found.<br> Today, as I walked down to the eastern shore,<br> I got a shock. I caught sight of one of those hated, evil, barbarian tribes with whom we have had so many problems before.<br> At first, I was naive and hoped that they were peaceful, but as soon as one of them saw me they charged towards me and started attacking me with their throwing-spears. Thanks be to the Gods that<br> I was able to flee and hide myself, before retreating back to our colony under cover of darkness.<br> Anyway, we must build up stronger military buildings as soon as possible.\"<br><br>-- NEW OBJECTIVE --<br> "
