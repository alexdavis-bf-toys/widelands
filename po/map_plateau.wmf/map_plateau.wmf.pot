"Finally! We have just taken our first step towards victory! Last night, we landed on the forbidden island and defeated the few guards that were watching the north-western part of the island. I am quite sure that none of the other warlords has detected us so far, so we should keep quiet and build up our infrastructure. Soon we will be strong enough to raid their positions."

"Let’s hope that Lanissa – the warlord holding sway over that castle – has not discovered our movements yet. Perhaps we have a chance of conquering that mighty building without a bigger fight! However, it is essential that we capture it. It will be the key to our reign over this island!"

"It is amazing how far one can see from the highest tower of the castle. We can watch the whole island. So now I wonder why Lanissa did not see us and thus did not prepare. Be that as it may, some things will never come to the light of day. The only important issue at the moment are the opposing troops still left. We have discovered enemy positions held by Erwyn to the north and east of the castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely commands the strongest warriors. In the south, we caught sight of some food infrastructures guarded by Jomo – a younger warlord – and we should take care of those infrastructures so we can cut off our enemies’ food supply."
