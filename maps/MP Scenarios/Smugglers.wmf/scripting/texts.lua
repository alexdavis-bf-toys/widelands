[[Smugglers is a fun map for 4 players. You and your partner start diagonally
to each other on a point symmetric island. There are plenty of smuggling tunnels
on this island each consisting of a receiving and a sending end. To establish a smuggling
route you need to build a warehouse on a sending/receiving spot while your team
mate has to build one on the corresponding receiving/sending spot. A ware is then transported
each 10 seconds. For harder to defend smuggling routes you get points for smuggling:
2 or 3 per ware. The first team to have %i points wins.]])
