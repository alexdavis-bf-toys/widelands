of the castle. We can watch the whole island. So now I wonder, why Lanissa has
not seen us and thus did not prepare. But well, some things will never come to
the light of day. The only important things at the moment are the left opposing
troops. We observed enemy's positions from Erwyn north and eastwards of the
castle. He is known to be a strong warlord and surely commands the strongest
warriors. In the south we caught sight of some guarded food infrastructures of Jomo -
a younger warlord – we should take care about that infrastructures and cut of
the food supply.]], obj_defeat_erwyn, obj_defeat_jomo),
