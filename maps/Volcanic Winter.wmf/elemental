descr=_"In the middle of the summer a bunch of volcanic eruptions drew the winter in. Suddenly the sun seems to be gone and the only light and heat sources left are those, who enforced this dramatic change. Continents, oceans and seas are freezing, only the volcanic islands seem to be left as habitable land."
